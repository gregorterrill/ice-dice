## Credits

This client was originally developed by [Abdullah Al-Faqeir](https://github.org/abdullahfaqeir) from 
[DevLoops](https://github.com/devloopsnet) and was 
[adopted](https://github.com/devloopsnet/typesense-php/issues/4) as the official PHP client library for Typesense in Oct 2020.

Ongoing development and support is now provided by Typesense, in addition to our collaborators.
